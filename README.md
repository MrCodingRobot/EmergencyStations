# Emergency Stations

This project is the development of smart emergency stations. This
stations reports, via cellular data, vital inventory information that
can assist the maintance of a large collection of emergency stations.
This helps ensure that all emergency stations are stocked sufficiently
and efficiently to assure that people in need actually have supplies
when an emergency occurs.

Within this repository, the hardware, software, and additional
documentation regarding the projects development are collected.
The goal of this repository is to ensure that development progress
into this project is documentated, to make the continuation of this
project possible.
